# Mushroom Classification Example

## Dataset Overview

This project utilizes the Mushroom Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which comprises characteristics of various mushroom species. The goal is to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on their features.

- **Dataset Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Mushroom Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom)
- **Attributes:** 22 categorical features, including cap shape, cap surface, cap color, bruises, odor, and habitat.
- **Instances:** 8124

## Objective

- To demonstrate the preprocessing of categorical data using one-hot encoding and classify the mushrooms as edible or poisonous using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Decision Tree classifiers.
